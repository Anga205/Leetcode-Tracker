# Auto-Updating Leetcode Progress Displayer

The initial of this repository was to give me a way to compare my leetcode progress to that of my friend [Munis](https://github.com/muniss950)
Nowadays i just use it to track my progress against all my friends

## How to run

This repository isnt really designed to be ran locally, it auto updates readings using github actions, and then deploys the website automatically using netlify

Its kinda meant to just be a thing I can setup and forget about
